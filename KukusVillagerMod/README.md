## How to :
To spawn villagers you need to craft a bed<br>
The villagers will spawn and get linked to the bed. <br>
To assign it a defense post you need to interact with the bed and then interact with a defense post. This will let the villager know that it has to defend that post <br>
To make a villager follow you, interact with him by tapping your interact key (E default). If you hold your interact key they will go back to guarding their base.<br>
You can craft the villager commander club to command villagers<br>
