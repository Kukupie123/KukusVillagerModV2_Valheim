## Known issues
Leave a comment in Nexus.


If bed is not loaded in your memory but the villager is, the villager will be destroyed once you load the game.
This is intended to prevent redundant villagers in world. A villager MUST have a bed.

If there are other bugs please visit my github repo and create an issue

## Roadmap

More commands
